            majority of your time and effort to something, it is amazing what
            you can accomplish in a short amount of time. I'm a full-stack
            developer with a background in research-oriented psychology and a
            passion for creating engaging, well-crafted, and interactive
            pages/applications. Known as a critical thinker, insightful
            contributor, and one who works well with and motivates members of
            project teams. I am well versed in using a variety of technologies
            to efficiently solve problems and enhance user experiences through
            refined functionality and detail-oriented design. Able to rapidly
            learn and implement new technologies and adapt to the demands of any
            project. Ready to apply skills as part of a quality-driven team to
            craft products which people are delighted to use and leave them with
            an indelible positive impression of the organization those products
            represent.

              {"\u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0 \u00A0"} For every project
              completed thus far, I have not only met, but exceeded the
              acceptance criteria. I always add to or improve upon the basic,
              required functionality so that the user can both do more with and
              have a more satisfying experience with my applications. I
              consistently go the extra mile with my CSS stylings to ensure my
              projects are professional and aesthetically appealing. While most
              of the projects below are quite common to see from bootcamp
              developers, you will notice that my versions indicate a developer
              who puts in the extra time and effort to make a superior product,
              with an emphasis on enhanced functionality and ease-of-use. By
              constantly striving to take my projects to the next level, I have
              learned how to provide the user a better, more complete experience
              and, in the process, have provided myself with additional learning
              opportunities through these extra challenges. I hope you enjoy the
              following examples of my work, and, if you have a dream for an
              application, I hope that you will contact me to help you build it!
